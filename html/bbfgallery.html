This is a plug-compatible replacement for the built-in WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode">gallery shortcode</a>. It is implemented using a <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> Model-View-Presenter (MVP) styled by a<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> Twitter Bootstrap 3</a> stylesheet. Using a MVP allows you to switch instantaneously (i.e. without doing a HTTP request) between multiple views of a gallery. The default implementation supports a gallery view, carousel view and a tabs view of the gallery. The view is styled by a Twitter Bootstrap 3 stylesheet so it is automatically responsive. If the browser supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">CSS3 Flexbox</a> the gallery view is implemented using a flexbox. You can easily modify the Backbone templates to create your own customized views of the gallery.

This plug-in is configured by setting options on the &quot;Settings &gt; Media&quot; page. Enabling the &quot;BB Gallery&quot; option replaces the built-in WordPress gallery shortcode implementation with this plug-in's implementation. If you do not enable this option you can still invoke this plug-in's gallery shortcode implementation using the shortcode &quot;bb_gallery&quot; e.g. &quot;&#91;bb_gallery&#93;&quot;. If you have enabled this option but want to invoke the built-in WordPress implementation you can specify the shortcode parameter &quot;mode&quot; with value &quot;wordpress&quot; e.g. &quot;&#91;gallery mode=&#39;wordpress&#39;&#93;&quot;. The <a href="#table">&quot;Table View&quot;</a> is primarily for developers and should be disabled for production environments.

An advantage of using Backbone.js is its support for the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) paradigm. This makes it easy to have multiple views of the same model. This plugin supports a gallery view of multiple small images, a carousel (slideshow) view, a tabs view of multiple tab panes and a table view.

&nbsp;
<h2 id="gallery">The Gallery View</h2>

&nbsp;
<h2 id="carousel">The Carousel View</h2>

&nbsp;
<h2 id="tabs">The Tabs View</h2>

&nbsp;
<h2 id="table">The Table View</h2>
This view is intended primarily for developers. It displays the field names exactly as you would use them in Backbone.js templates. This view can be displayed by enabling the <a href="#installation">&quot;Table View&quot; option</a> of the &quot;Settings &gt; Media&quot; page.

Backbone.js templates consists of HTML with placeholders for the values of the model e.g. &quot;&lt;img src=&#39;{{{ data.url }}}&#39;&gt;&quot;. Here &quot;url&quot; is the name of a field in the model. You can modify or create your own Backbone.js templates without knowledge of PHP or JavaScript (some JavaScript is needed for more advanced templates). You can get the available field names of the model from the <a href="#table">&quot;Table View&quot;</a>. See &quot;.../bbg_xiv-gallery_templates.php&quot; for the implementation of the default views. You can modify these views or create your own by editing this file. The simplest template is the template for the CCS 3 Flexbox view of the gallery. You should study this template first.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37" src="https://bbfgallery.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/flex_template.png" alt="flex_template" width="650" height="334" />

For each image in the gallery the plug-in's front-end code will instantiate the &quot;Flex Item Template&quot;. Then using the concatenation of all these instantiations as the value of data.items the &quot;Flex Container Template&quot; is instantiated.
