Plug-compatible replacement for the built-in WordPress gallery shortcode.

== Description ==
This is a plug-compatible replacement for the built-in WordPress gallery shortcode.
It is implemented using a Backbone.js Model-View-Presenter (MVP) styled by a Twitter Bootstrap 3 stylesheet.
Using a MVP allows you to switch instantaneously (i.e. without doing a HTTP request) between multiple views of a gallery.
The default implementation supports a gallery view, carousel view and a tabs view of the gallery.
The view is styled by a Twitter Bootstrap 3 stylesheet so it is automatically responsive.
If the browser supports the CSS3 Flexbox the gallery view is implemented using a flexbox.
You can easily modify the Backbone templates to create your own customized views of the gallery.
The homepage for this plug-in is [https://bbfgallery.wordpress.com/](https://bbfgallery.wordpress.com/).

== Installation ==
1. Upload the folder "bb-gallery" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Enable the BB Gallery option on the "Settings > Media" page.
