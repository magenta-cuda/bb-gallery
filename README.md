Backbone Bootstrap Gallery
==========================

## About

A plug-compatible replacement for the built-in WordPress gallery shortcode implemented with Backbone.js collections and models that are synchronized with the WordPress database using the WordPress REST API v2.
The front-end is made mobile-friendly by using components from Bootstrap and jQuery Mobile.

## Requirements

WordPress 4.5

[WordPress REST API (Version 2) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/)

## Installation

This plugin can use its own proprietary API or the WordPress REST API to populate the Backbone.js collections.
If the [WordPress REST API (Version 2) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) is installed and activated it will use the WordPress REST API otherwise it will use its own proprietary API.

## Warning

Using the WordPress REST API is not stable and is not complete.
